# Data Science & Honors Seminar Final Projects

This repository contains my final projects for the Data Science and Honors Seminar courses that I worked on during Fall 2022. As the projects were closely related, I have included them both here in the same repo.

For my honors seminar project see here: [396H](written-analysis/draft.md)
